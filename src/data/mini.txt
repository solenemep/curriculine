I got involved by curiosity in 2017, as an engineer, I was earing a lot from blockchain and wanted to understand the technology. 
Then I got involved technically in 2021 when I started to learn Solidity.

I have worked on 3 main projects : a DEFI insurance app, a NFT marketplace and a NFT game project.
On DEFI insurance project I spend most of my work experience and developed, maintained and tested (JS and Foundry) upgradeable contracts with the following specificities : 
- Yield Generator => integration of Aave, Compound and Yearn
- Voting System => encrypted voting system in 2 phases
- Staking and Rewarding contracts => with ERC20, ERC 721 tokens
- Vesting contract => including cliff and linear vesting
